        <p>This is an Amazon-like storefront created with the MySQL skills. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.</p>
        <p>*** What BAMAZON APP Should Do:</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>Challenge #1: Customer View</strong></p>
        <p>Customer View Create a MySQL Database called bamazon.</p>
        <p>Then create a Table inside of that database called products.</p>
        <p>The products table should have each of the following columns:</p>
        <p>* item_id (unique id for each product)</p>
        <p>* product_name (Name of product)</p>
        <p>* department_name</p>
        <p>* price (cost to customer)</p>
        <p>* stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)</p>

        <hr>

        <p>Populate this database with around 10 different products. (i.e. Insert "mock" data rows into this database and table).</p>
        <p>Then create a Node application called bamazonCustomer.js. </p>
        <p>Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.</p>
        <p>The app should then prompt users with two messages.</p>
        <p>** The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy. </p>
        <p>** The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.</p>

        <p>Once the customer has placed the order, your application should check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.</p>

        <p>If your store does have enough of the product, you should fulfill the customer's order.</p>

        <p>This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.</p>

        <p>Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.</p>

        <p>Check back your database table, you will see:</p>

        <hr>

        <p>However, if your store does not have enough of the product, the app should log a phrase like <strong>"Insufficient quantity!"</strong>, and then prevent the order from going through, and ask the customer to buy other product again.</p>
